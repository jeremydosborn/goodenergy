**Good Energy**

This repository is archived. Good Energy uses an obsolete Python 2.x / Django 1.x stack with end-of-life dependencies. It's preserved for reference only, do not deploy it without major refactoring. If you need a behavior-change tool today, treat this as a case study and rebuild on a modern stack, or contact one of the original developers for assistance.

Good Energy is a behavior change and employee engagement tool. It uses key results from social psychology research (social norms, pledges, identity) to assist individuals in achieving their goals. It has been deployed in production with the David Suzuki Foundation, focused on environmental sustainability, and with a Vancouver area school, focused on student self-improvement.
Good Energy was designed as a white-label product. The company purchasing it brands the header, footer, and CSS to look like their site. It then looks integrated into either a company Intranet, or a public Internet site.
The questions you get asked (top center), as well as the default Pledges (bottom right) are configurable via the django admin interface.

There's no official support. The original developers were [grahamking](https://github.com/grahamking) and [jeremydosborn](https://github.com/jeremydosborn).
You should have at least basic Django, Unix, and database skills before trying to set up this app. As long as you understand that, and you need a behavior change / employee engagement tool, we think you'll really like Good Energy.
